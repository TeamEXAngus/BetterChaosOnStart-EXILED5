# BetterChaosOnStart-EXILED5
A plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory overhaulling the mechanic of Chaos Insurgency soldiers spawning in place of Facility Guards when the round starts. This plugin gives server owners control over the chance which Chaos replaces Guards, the items which these Chaos spawn with, and more. Check out the [example config](https://github.com/TeamEXAngus/BetterChaosOnStart-EXILED5/blob/master/example-config.yml) or the [EXILED Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/PyUkWTg) for more info.
